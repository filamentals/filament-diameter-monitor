## Pitch narration
It is no secret that our world is drowning in plastic. These products that made our lives easy have long been unchecked. But no more! If we have the power to create plastic, we also have the power to re-shape it!

Since the dawn of time, humanity had the unresistible urge to shape the world around them. They built their civilization with the skills to mould materials, but in the process left the mother nature in peril. But no more! For if humanity can bend even the hardest metal to their will, they have the power to shape the destiny of their plastic trash. 

In the recent years, people have developed ways to re-use plastic. By putting them through steel and fire in an extruder, we can now reshape plastic in the form of filaments to be used in 3D-printers or other utilitarian purposes. However, unsupervised power yields no prosperity but only chaos. FilaMentals is a open-hardware project to create a low-cost monitoring system for the diameter of these filaments. Using a Raspberry Pi, camera, an LED and a 3D-printed casing, a FilaMental device gives a live reading of the filament diameter. The simplicity of the design allows it to be used in any custom made filament extruder. 

The future is bright, but it's surely brighter with FilaMentals in it. Our outlook involves establishing a feedback loop with the filament extruder, allowing automatic control of the machine to make filaments with thicknesses desired by the user. Thanks to this ease of use, we hope more people will be motivated to start extruding themselves and help with the global effort to battle plastic waste!
