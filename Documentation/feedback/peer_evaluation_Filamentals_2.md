## Report 

### Documentation:

1. **Could you understand the purpose of the experiment? Explain.
> In the part of Open Hardware and its purpose, there are links for people to look in detail of the background for the project and the used open hardware, which is desirable. However, I do think it would be better if there are more explanations of project purpose or a summarized description. The contents about the experiment purpose in both README and project canvas is a bit sketchy for now, which merely mention the custom-made extractors are insusceptible to produce a re-useable homogeneous filament in 3D printer. Indeed, this allows me to know the reason of building a monitoring system for filament extruder; whereas, without introducing why extractors fail to produce such a filament, how the extractors work and look like, and etc., it would be hard for me to obtain a deeper understanding of how much the monitoring system improve the facility. Also, there seems have a jump in the explanation of the aim, for instances, I am a bit confused on how this device aid to the recycling of the failed prints or unused prints. Doing measurements are not filling the gap of that.     

2. **Were the safety instructions clear? 
> Yes, the safety instructions are clear. There are warning symbols around the bolded safety remarks, which are placed in the right place and with appropriate amount.

3. **Was the starting point and the expected duration of the measurements clear in the documentation?  
> Despite the duration of the measurements is not shown, there is clear and readable instruction on performing the measurement. I can follow them easily. 

4. **Does the documentation contain all necessary information to successfully reproduce the measurement? If not, what was missing? 
> I found it is a bit difficult to push the material into the casing. During this process, the material is damaged a little bit and it is also stuck in the halfway. If this will affect the measurement result in some way (because the diameter might be slightly different) or disturbing the imaging (because there might be some crumbs left inside the casing after various measurements), I think this should be mentioned in the documentation.     

5. **Did you get stuck at some point? What extra help did you need to proceed?
> Everything is stated and labelled, that is good! I can follow every step on the hardware building. The steps for software installation are also listed in a good order with useful links and grey highlights. The code is not that difficult to comprehend.       

6. **Are you encouraged to reproduce previous measurements? How easily could you navigate through the project documentation?  
> Yes, there is not much error sources for the results of the measurement. If you can follow every step listed in the page and take care of the possible (procedural) errors, the results are quite stable. Meanwhile, the project documentation navigation is managed very well because each step is clearly stated. Both hardware and software components used are quite handy to construct. 

7. **What can be improved in the documentation?  
> Still, I hope there will be more explanations in the part of [working principles] ( projects/Filamentals_Ana_Yoldas_Zach/Software/WorkingPrinciples_summary.md) or the theoretical background. Also, if the pictures are adjusted in a smaller size and with some descriptions below, that would be nicer.   

On the scale of 1-5 (1: top quality, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the documentation? Please justify your grade based on the questions above.

#### Documentation grade: <mark>**2**</mark>

### Measurements:

1. **Can you operate the setup with the provided instructions? 
> Yes. Thanks for the labelling, that’s helpful and handy. 

2. **How close were the results you obtain to the previously reported results? 
> The resolution and shape of material edge obtained is quite like the provided results. Probably there is few millimeter’s differences, but that is omittable and within the acceptable range.  

3. **Is the analysis procedure easy to understand? Summarize it briefly in your own words.  
> All analysis of the measurement is done in the computer program. The graphical interface can calculate the thickness for us. We only need to compare the results. It is easy to handle.  

4. **Is the setup robust and safe to operate? 
> Yes, the setup is robust and safe and the caution about the power is also stated clearly. One thing is the thickness of material seems not fit the hole of the casing very well, maybe it is good to either make the hole larger or produce the thickness of material smaller.   

5. **Did you encounter any issues? Could you troubleshoot those issues without contacting the owners?
> No, everything is done smoothly. For troubleshooting, there is enough help from the part of possible errors.

6. **What part of the measurement procedure did you appreciate most?  
> I appreciate the part of test measurement; they are clear and simple.  

On the scale of 1-5 (1: top quality, 5: disappointing) how do you assess the measurements reproducibility? Please justify your grade based on the questions above.

#### Reproducibility grade: <mark>**1.5**</mark>

### Interactions:

1. **If you had to perform work on this part of the project, would you have selected the same goal or aimed at something else? Please, explain. 
> As mentioned above, I am not fully understanding the purpose of this project. I also think the measurement on the thickness is the main thing of this device, but if I could realize in a deeper way of its function, I would probably aim on other things.   

2. **Which instructions did you need from the owners on top of the written files?  
> The written files are well and sufficient.

3. **Does the experiment accomplish its stated purpose? 
> Yes, its measure the thickness as expected.

4. **What do you recommend to the project owners to improve their complete package?  
> I think add a README files to every subfolders would be better. Another thing is I feel the measurement maybe a bit simple. I recommend adding more type of measurements.
