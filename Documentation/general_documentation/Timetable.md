# FilaMental's Timetable 

**Preface**: For scheduling we are using an [online calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=f06857b2ff3cc8d11cd362d8e63e9a1f77edd87b7c4e3b42675fb1ee770b57b3%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe%2FBerlin) to plan and keep track of free time slots of the group.

## Week of September 25th:
- [X] Update Raspberry Pi OS
- [X] Connect PiCamera
- [X] Collect first image
- [X] Determine lens range
- [X] Decide if we'll use current camera case
  - Won't use the current one --> need to make a new one due to the fact that camera should be covered from external light. See [logbook](LogBook.md#300922-friday-first-use-of-opencv).
- [X] Get familiar with Python and OpenCV

 ## Week of October 2nd:
- [X] Design base for stabilizing the filament
- [X] Design method of attachment to either a printer or extruder
